# Mocks

This directory contains mocks for testing. The mocks are generated from
interfaces defined in testutil/interfaces_to_mock.go.

Do not edit the go files in this directory. If you need to change them,
edit the interface definitions in testutil/interfaces_to_mock.go and then
regenerate the mocks using the following commands:

`mockery -dir testutil -name MinioClient`

`mockery -dir testutil -name RedisClient`

If the mockery binary is not in your path, use `$GOPATH/bin/mockery`.
